# Banana-Ripeness-Predictor-

An AI-powered computer vision and machine learning system that predicts banana ripeness stages (Green, Yellow, Brown, Mushy) and estimates remaining shelf life.
Built using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and FastAPI, the project integrates an end-to-end ML pipeline from image preprocessing and model training to real-time cloud deployment on Heroku/Render.

🚀 Features

🧠 Deep Learning Model: Multi-output CNN trained for both ripeness classification and shelf-life regression.

🔍 Computer Vision: Automated feature extraction using OpenCV and Pillow.

⚙️ End-to-End ML Pipeline: Data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

☁️ Cloud Deployment: FastAPI backend integrated with Heroku/Render for real-time inference.

🔄 MLOps Practices: Model monitoring, performance tracking, and reproducibility.

📊 Scalable & Extensible: Can be adapted for other fruits or perishable item freshness prediction.

🧩 Tech Stack

Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, FastAPI, Heroku/Render

📈 Use Case

This project demonstrates how AI and cloud automation can support agri-tech and retail industries by reducing food waste and optimizing supply chains through data-driven freshness prediction.
